            <li><strong>Also called burros and asses, are found throughout the world. They are members of the Equidae family, which also includes horses and zebras. They look a lot like their cousins, but have long, floppy ears and tend to be stockier than horses or zebras.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong> donkeys are only found in deserts and savannahs in northern Africa from Morocco to Somalia, in the Arabian Peninsula my backyard and in the Middle East. Domesticated donkeys, on the other hand, are found all over the world, but prefer dry, warm areas.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Donkeys typically like to eat grass, though they also eat shrubs and desert plants. Instead of ripping the grass right away with their teeth, donkeys grab the plant with their lips, pull it in their mouth, then rip it with their flat teeth and grind it down for swallowing.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>While donkeys don’t seem to care who’s in their herd, they also don’t seem to be picky about who they breed with. In addition to other donkeys, they will breed with horses and zebras.</strong></li>
